## 1.0.3 (2010-02-11)

* Added support for scheduled jobs with empty crons. This is helpful to have
  jobs that you don't want on a schedule, but do want to be able to queue by
  clicking a button.

## 1.0.2 (2010-02-?)

* Change Delayed Job tab to display job details if only 1 job exists
  for a given timestamp

## 1.0.1 (2010-01-?)

* Bugfix: delayed jobs close together resulted in a 5 second sleep
